# Project1

 In this project, we are required to create the following pages:
 1) Home page
 2) Register page
 3) Login page
 4) Personal Profile Page
 5) View/Search Profile Matches
 
 My project contains all of the pages requested including a HTTP static file server.
 The background image for the home page is in CSS defined only of aesthetic value - not visual content of the document itself. Hence, an alternative text for this particular image does not contain an alternative text.
 The rest of the image(s) used for this project that's within the <b>img tag</b> contains an alternative text.
 All pages are expected to be mobile responsive.
